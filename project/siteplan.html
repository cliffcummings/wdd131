            </h2>

            <p>
                The new web pages are intended to use proper techniques learned in class to
                both simplify and improve the web pages located at www.sunburst-design.com

            <h2>Sunbrust Design papers page</h2>
            <p>
                The papers page holds information about the 50+ conference papers that I have
                given since 1993. This page is frequently visited by engineers and engineering 
                students to download my papers. If you do a scholar.google.com search on
                ("cliff cummings" AND verilog) you will find that my papers are frequently 
                referenced by engineers and universities. The objective is to make this page
                friendly and usable by mobile devices.

        <h2>About scripts/sunburst.js file</h2>
        <p>
            This file has already been populated with 1400 lines of paper data to be inserted
            into the properly formated papers page. The original version of this page uses a
            very large number of tables and table-cells and is very hard to maintain.
            See the original papers-page at www.sunburst-design.com/papers

            <p>
                The training page will list training courses offerings by
                Paradigm Works/Sunburst Design. The page will also include contact information
                to request more information about our training classes. This is intended to 
                replace the current training page viewable at www.sunburst-design.com/verilog_training
